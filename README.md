# aliasing:
Aliasing is giving a sort name to the data.
We have module aliasing, function aliasing, variable aliasing or a particular library aliasing.
When we have a module or function with a bigger name and we need to use it time and again we give a small name. This is called alliasig.
Example: import library_xyz as ab.
